My Portfolio Explorer
=========================

## Overview
This app will look in the current project context for portfolio items. It will then attempt to show a dendogram style ancestral tree. This allows you to see where your items fit into the bigger picture, if you have visibility of them. 
If you don't they just appear as part of your 'World'.

If you hover over a particular dot, it will give you a 'rallycard' style pop-up. If you click on the dot, it gives you that card and then a list of the children associated with it. This works for all levels of portfolio item, so for features, 
you will see the child user stories

The advanced filters panel is available to select the items of the type chosen in the 'starting' level of portfolio item. Some of the fields available don't yet work so it might be a suck-it-and-see approach to that.

You can track back up the hierarchy and then by clicking on a parent of one of your items, you can see the 'other' children associated with yours that make up that parent.
